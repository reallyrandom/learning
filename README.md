# Learning tips 

- [Learning How To Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course on Coursera is amazing and very useful. Take the full course, or read this [summary](https://medium.com/learn-love-code/learnings-from-learning-how-to-learn-19d149920dc4) on Medium.

- **Track concepts - "To learn", "Revising", "Done"**
	- Any terms I couldn't easily explain went on to post-its. 
	- One term per post-it. 
	- "To learn", "Revising", "Done" was written on my whiteboard and I moved my post-its between these categories, I attended to this every few days.
	- I looked up terms everyday, and I practiced recalling terms and explaining them to myself every time I remembered I had these interviews coming up (frequently).
	- I carried around a notebook and wrote down terms and explanations. 
	- Using paper reduces distractions.

- **How to review concepts**
	- Use spaced-repition.
	- Don't immediately look up the asnwer, EVEN IF you have never seen the term before. Ask yourself what the term means. Guess the answer. Then look it up.
	- Review terms *all the time*. You can review items in your head at any time. If I was struggling to fall asleep, I'd go through terms in my head and explained them to myself. 100% success rate of falling asleep in less than 10 minutes, works every time. 

- **Target your learning**
	- Think *hard* about what specific team you are going for, what skills do they want? If you aren't sure, then ask someone who will definitely know.

- **Identify what you need to work on** 
	- Spend more time doing the difficult things
	- If you're weak on coding and you find yourself avoiding it, then spend most of your study time doing that.

- **Read**
	- Read relevant books (you don't have to read back to back).
	- When looking up things online, avoid going more than two referral links deep - this will save you from browser tab hell.

- **Mental health**
	- Take care of your basic needs first - sleep, eat well, drink water, gentle exercise. You know yourself, so do what's best for you.
	- You are more than your economic output, remember to separate your self worth from your paycheque. 
	- See interviews for what they are - they are *not* a measure of you being "good enough".


# Interviewing tips 

- **Interview questions**
	- Interview questions are intentionally vague. This is to encourage questions.
	- Ask clarifying questions 
	- Questions reveal how you approach problems.
	- Write down notes about the question. This is so you don't forget details and only partially answer, or give the wrong answer.
	- Interviews should be more like a conversation with a lot of back and forth, thoroughly explore scenarios together and avoid jumping too fast to a solution.
	- The interviewer can only make an evaluation on your suitability for the job based on the things you *say*. 
	- **Interviewers test depth of knowledge**
		- There will be questions about technical details on topics to the point where it'll be hard to answer. This is okay, try your best to work through it and say what you're thinking.
		- Interviewers often aren't looking for specific answers, they just want to see how deeply you know a topic.
		- Approach the question from a low level and even ask your interviewer if you need to add more details before moving on.
	- **Interviewers test breadth of knowledge**
		- There will be questions related to the role you're applying for and some that aren't. This is to explore breadth of knowledge. 
		- Try your best to explore the scenarios and ask questions. It's very important to say your thinking aloud, you might be on the right track.

- **Show comprehension**
	- Try to always ask clarifying questions even if you think you already know the answer. You might learn some nuance that even improves your idea.
	- Always repeat the question back to the interviewer to both check your understanding and give yourself thinking time.
	- *"Okay, I'll repeat back the question so I can check my understanding…"*
	- *"Just to clarify…"*
	- *"I just want to check I heard correctly…"*
	
- **State your assumptions**
	- Your interviewer will provide feedback if your assumptions are unreasonable.
	- *"I am going to assume that the organisation is collecting x,y,z logs from hosts and storing these for at least 90 days…"* 
	- *"Can I make the assumption that…?"*
	- *"Let's say that we can get x,y,z information…"*

- **When asked a question you're not sure of the answer to right away, try these phrases:**
	- *"I don't know but if I had to invent it, it would be like this…"*
	- *"I don't know that exactly but I know something about a similar subject / sub component…"*
	- *"This is what's popping into my mind right now is…"*
	- *"The only thing that is coming to mind is…"* 
	- *"I know a lot about [similar thing], I could talk about that instead? Would that be okay?"*

- **Say what you are thinking**
	- The interviewer can only make an evaluation on your suitability for the job based on the things you *say*. 
	- If you don't say your thought process aloud, then the interviewer doesn't know what you know. 
	- You may well be on the right track with an answer. You'll be kicking yourself afterwards if you later realise you were but didn't say anything (I missed out on an internship because of this!)
	- Write pseudo code for your coding solution so you don't have to hold everything in your head.
	- *"Right now I am thinking about…"*
	- *"I am thinking about different approaches, for example…"*
	- *"I keep coming back to [subject/idea/thing] but I think that's not the right direction. I am thinking about…"*
	- *"I'm interested in this idea that…"*

- **Reduce cognitive load**
	- Take notes on the question and assumptions during the interview.
	- If the infrastructure is complicated, draw up what you think it looks like. 
	- Write pseudocode. 
	- Write tests and expected output for code you write, test your code against it. 

- **Prepare**
	- Make a checklist that reminds you of what to do for each question, something like:
		- Listen to interview question
		- Take notes on the question
		- Repeat the question
		- Ask clarifying questions
		- State any assumptions
	- Prepare questions that you want to ask your interviewers at the end of the interview so you don't need to think of them on the spot on the day. Since an interview is also for you to know more about the workplace, I asked questions about the worst parts of the job. 
	- Bring some small snacks in a box or container that isn't noisy and distracting. A little bit of sugar throughout the interviews can help your problem solving abilities. 
	- Stay hydrated - and take a toilet break between every interview if you need to (it's good to take a quiet moment).

- **Do practice interviews**
	- Do them until they feel more comfortable and you can easily talk through problems.
	- Ask your friends/peers to give you really hard questions that you definitely don't know how to answer.
	- Practice being in the very uncomfortable position where you have no idea about the topic you've been asked. Work through it from first principles.
	- Practice speaking aloud everything you know about a topic, even details you think might be irrelevant. 
	- Doooo theeeeemmm yes they can be annoying to organise but it is *worth it*.

### Interviewers are potential friends and they want to help you get the job, they are on your side. Let them help you, ask them questions, recite everything you know on a topic and *say your thought process out loud*.'
